# Sort

- A Typescript node.js application that has implementation to sort numbers, strings and linked list
- Uses classed based inheritance to establish modularized code
- Uses "abstract classes" to inherit common functions
- Set up to create future classes which can handle sorting any type of data structure
- Currently uses bubble sort but the file structure can be applied to any sorting algorithm
